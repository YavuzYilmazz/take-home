# Software Engineer Take-Home Project

## Objective
This project assesses your ability to evolve a proof-of-concept script into a robust, production-ready data pipeline. You will be given a simple, functional Python script that scrapes data from a mock API. Your task is to analyze its shortcomings and refactor it into a reliable and efficient piece of software. We are looking for clean code, thoughtful architectural decisions, and a solid understanding of production-readiness.

## Context
You are given a Python script (`scraper.py`) that fetches job posting data from a mock API. The current script **works**, but it was written quickly and has significant flaws related to performance, error handling, and code quality. Your job is to fix it.

## Core Requirements
Your primary goal is to reliably fetch and store all job postings for all companies available from the API.

- **Production-Ready Scraper:** Refactor the initial scraper.py script. The final version must be efficient, robust, and configurable.
- **Data Integrity and Validation:** You must clean, validate, and normalize the raw data before storage. The final, stored data should be uniform and predictable.
- **Data Persistence:** The processed data should be saved to a file upon successful completion of the script.

## Final Deliverables
- All modified Python source code.
- Your completed tests.py file.
- A README.md file that explains:
    - The key architectural decisions you made and the reasoning behind them.
    - A discussion of the trade-offs you considered.
    - Clear instructions on how to install dependencies, run your script, and run your tests.
- At the end of your README.md, include the following summary generated by a successful run of your script:
    - Total number of companies processed: [Number]
    - Total jobs stored: [Number]
    - Total applicants counted: [Number]

## Running the Mock API Server (Docker)

The project includes a `docker-compose.yaml` file to easily run the mock API server without needing to build it from source. You must have Docker installed on your machine.

**Important Note on CPU Architecture:**

The `docker-compose.yaml` file is pre-configured to pull a Docker image that matches a specific CPU architecture (e.g., Apple Silicon vs. Intel/AMD).

* For **Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3) Macs**, the default `canariaapp/mock-api-server:0.1-arm64` image should work correctly.
* For **Intel or AMD-based machines (including most Windows and Linux PCs)**, you must edit the `docker-compose.yaml` file and change the image to `canariaapp/mock-api-server:0.1-amd64`.

To start the server, run the following command from the project root. This will download the server image from Docker Hub and start it.

```bash
docker compose up
```
To verify the server is running, you can execute the provided test script in a new terminal:
```bash
python test_api_connection.py
```

## API Endpoints
- `GET /companies`: Provides the list of all company identifiers.
- `GET /jobs`: Fetches job postings. This endpoint requires parameters to specify the company.


## Submissions
This assignment is intentionally challenging. Do your best. If you run out of time or cannot complete every requirement, submit a partial solution. We value your approach, reasoning, and trade-offs. In partial submissions, please include:
- Clear notes on what is done vs. not done
- Known limitations and bugs
- What you would implement next and how
